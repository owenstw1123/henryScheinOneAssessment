To setup and run the application you will need:
java 17 or greater
maven 4.0 or greater
an IDE which can run maven projects (I used IntelliJ IDEA)

To run the application, import the project into your IDE, then run the file com/assessment/AssessmentApplication.java
To run the API methods, first make sure that the above mentioned file is running. Then you can use either a terminal to run curl requests, or a service like Postman to make your requests

Available endpoints are

Books:
GET endpoints:
    /books
        -returns all books in the database
    
    /books/{book_id}
        -returns information about a specific book

Post endpoints:
    /books
        -requires a Book object with title and author fields
        -creates a new Book with the supplied title and author

Borrowers:
GET endpoints:
    /borrowers
       -returns all borrowers in the database

    /borrowers/{borrower_id}
        -returns information about a specific borrower

Post endpoints:
    /borrowers
        -requires a Borrower object with name
        -creates a new Borrower with the supplied name

Borrowings:
Get endpoints:
    /borrowings
        -returns all borrowings in the database

    /borrowings/borrower_id/{borrower_id}
        -returns all borrowings by a particular borrower

    /borrowings/borrow/book_id/{book_id}/borrower_id/{borrower_id}
        -creates a borrowing record for the specified borrower and book

    /borrowings/return/book_id/{book_id}/borrower_id/{borrower_id}
        -updates a borrowing record to indicate that the book has been returned

Assumptions made:
    -Books cannot be borrowed by more than one borrower at a time
    -a list of borrowings which include book ids constitutes a list of books
